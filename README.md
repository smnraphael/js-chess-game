# Javascript Chess Game

## Why I chose this game?

Before I start learning about programming one year ago, I was looking for a youtubeur's videos and he decided to learn programming by doing a Chess Game so it inspired me to do the same thing. And also because I like playing Chess.

## Key features

- Render Board
- Render / place pieces on the board
- Move pieces
- Calculate possible moves for each piece
- Allow to eat opponent pieces only (not our own pieces)
- Pawn promotion
- Start / Reset buttons
- Resign buttons
- Timers
- Cemetery
- Sound effects

## What's next?

I want to re-start the project from scratch but using a matrix, and adding the position of the pieces in their respective classes. The current structure of my code made it difficult to use and to create a function to check if the King is in check.
